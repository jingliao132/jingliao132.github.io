## Bio
I am a Ph.D candidate of Digital Art and Design at the College of Computer Science and Technology. I have Machine Learning undergraduate background. My primary interests are **computational tools that serve human interests, action-taking, decision-making in design and creative activity**. My research aim is to distribute knowledge of computer science to the field of human creation. Currently, I am engaged in design cognition theories that explain designers perceive, understand, communicate and transform visual and semantic information; adaptive interaction techniques that accommodate individual traits in designing, and a framework of a human-computer integrated design.

## Hobby
I love traveling. I am also an amateur photographer and advanced open water diver. You may find beautiful moments and interesting thoughts at [here](https://jingliao132.github.io/portfolio).
