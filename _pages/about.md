## Bio
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Digital Art and Design at Zhejiang University. I received a bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology at the South China University of China, where I joined the Machine Learning and Cybernetic Lab. My primary interests are **computational support tools in design and creative activities, aiming to serve designers' needs in action-taking and decision-making**. My research aim is to distribute knowledge in computer science to the design and creativity community. Currently, I am engaged in design cognition about how designers perceive, understand, process, and communicate visual and semantic information; adaptive interaction techniques that accommodate individual traits in designing, and interactive interface for human-computer collaborative design.

## Hobby
I love traveling. I am also an amateur photographer and advanced open water diver. You may find beautiful moments and interesting thoughts at [here](https://jingliao132.github.io/portfolio).
