## Bio
I am the Ph.D candidate of Digital Art and Design at the college of Computer Science and Technology. My primary interests are   **computational tools that serve human interests, action-taking and decision-making in design activity**. I hope to distribute knowledge of computer science to the field of human creation. My goal is to build a human-machine integrated design framework. Currently, I am working on design cognition theories that explain designers perceive, understand, communicate and transform visual and semantic information; as well as adaptive interaction techniques that accommodate individual traits in designing.

## Hobby
I love traveling. I am also an amateur photographer and advanced open water diver. Many [works](https://jingliao132.github.io/portfolio) are captured during travels.
