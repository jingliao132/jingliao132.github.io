## Abstract
Touchscreens are considered as a friendly interface for elderly people. However, a gap between young users and older users was still observed in either interaction performance or user experience. Although previous studies have identified the gap is associated with age-related characteristics, most researches are focused on specific input or output elements. This heterogeneity of research subjects makes it difficult to understand, compare and to recommend proper techniques for a specific design. Accordingly, we provided a review, thoroughly describing the efforts on the touch-based system and the elderly population in the past decade and answering the following questions: (1) How to identify characteristics that sensitive to performance and experience? (2) How to accommodate for elderlyâ€™s special interests? We also summarized the relevant design guidance, and provides novel perspectives of inclusive technical design for the elderly. Our work may enlighten those who is interested in the design of both hardware and software elements for the elderly.
