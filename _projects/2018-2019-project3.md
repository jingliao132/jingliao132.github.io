This project is initialized on Sept, 2018. It aims to explore possibilities of AI supports for early design activities, e.g., idea finding, idea delivery and idea evaluation. The literature would include theories of inspiration mechanism in design, psychology, and design cognition. The experimental study would conduct with HCI principles and methods. Finally, (1) a  framework of design ideation with AI will be built; (2) novel design supports will be designed for practical design ideation; and (3) implications of barriers and guidelines will be discussed.

The project will cover three stages:
* Survey: Literature study on design, creativity and design methods and tools
* Development: Design novel design tools 
  * Hardware: PC, Nvidia 1080Ti, Sketchpad
  * Software: Django, Pytorch
* Evaluation: System evaluation and User study (Questionnaire, Interview)
* Summary: Summarize research process and findings
