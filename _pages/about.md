## Bio
I am the Ph.D candidate of Digital Art and Design at the college of Computer Science and Technology. My primary interests are   **computational tools that serve human interests, action-taking and decision-making in design activity**, including design cognition theories that explains how designers perceive, understand, communicate and transform visual and semantic information, and HCI practice and guidelines that provide assistive tools in cognitive processes. My goal is an framework of human-machine integrated design method. Currently, I am working on adaptive interaction techniques, aiming to provide design assists that include individual difference of design ideation. You can reach to my [CV](https://github.com/jingliao132/jingliao-personal-website/CV) as well as project [code and data](https://github.com/jingliao132).
