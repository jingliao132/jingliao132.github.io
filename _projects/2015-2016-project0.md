This project is conducted during undergraduate years. I invote four classmates and apply for funding on research of pattern recognition problem in condition that data distribution is neither evenly distributed nor static. The research project is supervised by Prof.W.W.Y NG. His research covers optimization of neural network and classification problems in machine learning.<br>

We focus on Learn++ family algorithms that can effectively deal with dynamic data distribution. The changes of class distribution in  temporal data are referred as "Concept Drift", which demands adaptive algorithms to help the classifer update knowledge about decision boudnary to avoid performance decay.<br>

Meanwhile, practical class distribution is likely to be imbalanced. Take binary classification as example, samples of majority class are overwhelming to samples of minority class. Imbalanced data brings more challenges to temporal data classification because majority class and minority class may exchange each other. Techniques to overcome data imbalance should take dynamics of majority/minority, and include a special case when the whole dataset reach equilibrium and minimal involvements of these techniques are required.<br>

We examine performance of five classifiers as base classifiers of three Learn++ algorithms under difference concept drifts. We incorporate with Diversified Sensitivity Undersampling with the best Learn++ model robost to concept drifting. A new bonus technique is introduced to imporve classifier accuracy under both changes in concepts and imbalance of data. We experiment model variants on five concept drifting datasets and report results and discussions in dynamic and imbalanced classification.<br>
