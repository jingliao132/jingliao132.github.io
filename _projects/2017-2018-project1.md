This project focus on communicable and reusable computational design tools for industrial design. We propose a software based on SolidWorks, and provide interactive tools for both the model and color design of products. The design tools are driven by Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GA is based on computational analogy of biological process of natural selection. By defining some general metrics for individual (a product), the population (a set of product candidates) gradually evolves towards desirable directions in design space. Designers can interfere the evolve process by selecting desirable individuals. This allows features in the selected individuals are very likely preserved and interleaved.

GA is a optimization method suitable for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. It is natural for design optimization for being inclusive to complex, unclear and evolving characteristics of design activities.
