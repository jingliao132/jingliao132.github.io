Data analysis and visualization is playing an increasingly important role in business decision-making. This project aims to provide a computational tool for automatic information extraction, summarization and visualization in business activity. We consider technological aspects of text processing techniques, as well as human aspects in order to provide reliable and user-friendly interaction. We will study  text analysis in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and built model of stakeholders (companies, users) by Human-Computer Interaction approaches.

## Oppotunities and Challenges
Algorithms can reveal underlying patterns of customers' demograpics, accustoms and behaviors free of subjective bias. Visulization techniques can deliver rich and instant computational results for growing new knowledge of the market. However, designing these computational supports for daily business activities is very challenging. Business decision-making involves perhaps the most complicated forms of intelligence e.g., holistic understanding, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking and problem solving. Apart from effectiveness and ease-of-use of the computational tools, bridging psycological and cognitive gaps between traditional sense-making and computer-aided decision-making require to be examined in practical usage.

## Overview
The project will cover NLP applications and HCI practice:
* Survey: Understand user needs and requirements, define problems to be solved
* NLP research: Provide technical solutions to problems
* HCI research: Conduct system evaluation and user study
* Summary: Analyse own design activity, iterations and looking-back
